DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains the source code and supporting documentation for trim,
an ANSI C space trimmer and tab removal program.  It replace tab characters
with enough spaces to reach the next tab stop.  Any trailing spaces will also
be removed, and native line endings will be used.

Trim is released under the GNU GPL.

FILES
-----
COPYING         - Rules for copying and distributing GPL software
Makefile        - makefile for this project (assumes gcc compiler and GNU make)
README          - this file
trim.c          - Main functions for this program
/optlist        - Subtree containing optlist command line option parser library

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc:
1. Windows users should define the environment variable OS to be Windows or
   Windows_NT.  This is often already done.
2. Enter the command "make" from the command line.

USAGE
-----
Usage: trim <options>

Options:
  -t : Tab size.
  -k : Keep tabs.  Do not convert them to spaces.
  -i <filename> : Name of input file.
  -o <filename> : Name of output file.
  -h | ?  : Print out command line options.

Default: trim -t4 -i stdin -o stdout

HISTORY
-------
12/30/06  - Initial release
08/31/07  - Explicitly licensed under LGPL version 3.
          - Replaces getopt() with optlist library.
10/01/10  - Writes output 1 character at a time instead of 1 line at a time.
            This requires less system memory.
          - Added "Keep Tabs" mode, -k.
          - Changed license to GPL (was LGPL).
07/13/17  - Reorganized for ease of use with git/github
          - optlist is now a subtree

TODO
----
- Allow tab stop columns to be specified
- Add features found in source beautification programs
- Add a space to tab feature for crazy people that prefer tabs

BUGS
----
- "Keep Tabs" mode even keeps tabs after last non-whitespace.
