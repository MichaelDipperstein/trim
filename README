DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains the source code and supporting documentation for trim,
an ANSI C space trimmer and tab removal program.  It replace tab characters
with enough spaces to reach the next tab stop.  Any trailing spaces will also
be removed, and native line endings will be used.

Trim is released under the GNU GPL.

HISTORY
-------
12/30/06  - Initial release
08/31/07  - Explicitly licensed under LGPL version 3.
          - Replaces getopt() with optlist library.
10/01/10  - Writes output 1 character at a time instead of 1 line at a time.
            This requires less system memory.
          - Added "Keep Tabs" mode, -k.
          - Changed license to GPL (was LGPL).

TODO
----
- Allow tab stop columns to be specified
- Add features found in source beautification programs
- Add a space to tab feature for crazy people that prefer tabs

BUGS
----
- "Keep Tabs" mode even keeps tabs after last non-whitespace.
